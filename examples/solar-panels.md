# Example: Should I Install Solar Panels?

## The Question

> "Should I get solar panels installed on my house in Virginia in February 2026? My house is shaded a bit. What are the benefits for and against?"

## Analysis Mode Selected: ⚔️ Argue Both Sides

## The Case FOR Installing Solar Panels

### 1. Financial Incentives Are Strong Right Now
- **Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC)**: 30% tax credit through 2032, then steps down
- **Virginia-specific incentives**: Net metering allows you to sell excess power back to the grid at retail rates
- **Dominion Energy rebates**: Additional utility incentives may be available
- **Property tax exemption**: Virginia exempts solar equipment from property tax assessments

### 2. Long-Term Cost Savings
- Average Virginia electricity rate: ~$0.12-0.14/kWh and rising
- Solar panels have 25-30 year warranties with minimal degradation
- After payback period (typically 8-12 years), electricity is essentially free
- Hedge against future electricity price increases

### 3. Home Value Increase
- Studies show solar adds 3-4% to home resale value
- Buyers increasingly value energy independence
- Solar homes sell faster in many markets

### 4. Partial Shade Isn't Disqualifying
- Modern microinverters and power optimizers handle shade much better than older string inverters
- Shade analysis tools can optimize panel placement
- Even 70-80% sun exposure can be viable with proper system design
- Trees can be trimmed; shade patterns change seasonally

### 5. Environmental Impact
- Reduce carbon footprint by 3-4 tons CO2 annually per typical system
- Virginia's grid still relies heavily on natural gas and some coal
- Direct contribution to clean energy transition

## The Case AGAINST Installing Solar Panels

### 1. Shade Significantly Reduces ROI
- **This is your biggest problem.** Even "a bit" of shade can reduce output 20-40%
- Payback period extends from 8-10 years to 12-15+ years with significant shading
- Microinverters help but don't eliminate the efficiency loss
- If shade comes from neighbor's trees, you have no control over future growth

### 2. Virginia Is Not Ideal for Solar
- Virginia averages 4.5-5.0 peak sun hours/day vs 5.5-6.5 in Southwest states
- Winter production (when you're considering this) is lowest—December/January produce 40-50% of summer months
- Cloudy/rainy periods further reduce output
- You're not in Arizona or California where the math is obviously favorable

### 3. Upfront Cost Is Substantial
- Average 6kW system in Virginia: $15,000-$20,000 before incentives
- Even with 30% tax credit, you're paying $10,500-$14,000 out of pocket
- If financing, interest costs eat into savings
- That capital could earn 7-10% annually in index funds instead

### 4. Technology Is Still Improving
- Panel efficiency increases ~0.5% annually
- Battery storage costs dropping 10-15% per year
- Waiting 2-3 years could get you better panels at lower prices
- Early adopters often miss better technology waves

### 5. Hidden Costs and Complications
- Roof condition: If roof needs replacement in <10 years, you'll pay to remove and reinstall panels
- Tree trimming: May need ongoing maintenance if shade is from your trees
- HOA restrictions: Some Virginia HOAs still create obstacles despite state solar access laws
- Insurance: Some policies require riders for solar installations
- Inverter replacement: Typically needed at 10-15 years ($1,000-2,000)

### 6. Net Metering Isn't Guaranteed Forever
- Utilities are lobbying to reduce net metering rates nationwide
- Virginia's favorable rates could change by the time you'd benefit most
- California already reduced net metering compensation significantly

## The Crux

The debate hinges on: **How much does "shaded a bit" actually reduce your solar production?**

This isn't a question you can answer without data. You need:
1. A professional shade analysis (most installers do this free)
2. Specific production estimates for YOUR roof, YOUR trees, YOUR orientation
3. A comparison of projected output vs. a fully unshaded system

If shade reduces production by <20%: Solar is likely worth it
If shade reduces production by 20-35%: Marginal, depends on your priorities
If shade reduces production by >35%: Probably not worth it financially

## Verdict

**Winner**: AGAINST with **medium confidence**

The phrase "shaded a bit" is doing a lot of work here, and that vagueness is itself a red flag. You don't have the data to make this decision yet. The combination of:
- Meaningful shade (unknown severity)
- Virginia's mediocre solar resources
- Substantial upfront cost
- Improving technology

...suggests you should **get a professional shade analysis before proceeding**. If you're rationalizing around the shade issue ("it's just a bit"), that's a cognitive bias (optimism bias) that could cost you $15,000+.

**However**, if the shade analysis shows <20% production loss AND you plan to stay in this house 10+ years AND your roof is in good condition, then FOR would be correct.

## Recommended Actions

- [ ] **Do First**: Get 2-3 free quotes with shade analysis reports
- [ ] **Validate**: Ask installers for projected kWh/year with YOUR specific shade conditions
- [ ] **Calculate**: Compare 25-year NPV of solar vs. investing the same money at 7% return
- [ ] **Avoid**: Signing any contract before seeing shade analysis data

## Fallacies/Biases to Watch For

| Pattern | How It Might Appear |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Optimism Bias** | "The shade isn't that bad" without measurement |
| **Sunk Cost** | "I already got quotes, might as well proceed" |
| **Social Proof** | "My neighbor got solar and loves it" (their roof may be unshaded) |
| **Present Bias** | Focusing on tax credit deadline rather than 25-year economics |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Only reading pro-solar content, dismissing skeptical analysis |
